To allow anyone to use ServiceGraph for visualizing microservices dependencies, a scalable & flexible data flow has been developed.

## Core Components

- SDKs/Webhooks (Captures dependencies from microservices)
- Backend API (Stores dependency data)
- Database (Efficient storage & querying)
- Frontend (D3.js Graph) (Interactive visualization)
